# react-virtual-masonry

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- [#62](https://github.com/2wheeh/kaskaid/pull/62) [`8918161`](https://github.com/2wheeh/kaskaid/commit/8918161cbfb5dbb77e8654900fbddd77fbe8f42b) Thanks [@2wheeh](https://github.com/2wheeh)! - Rename the package from `react-virtual-masonry` to `kaskaid`.

  The component and hook API is unchanged — `<Masonry />`, `useMasonry`, and `useEndReached` keep their names. Only the package specifier and the emitted data attributes change.

  ```diff
  -import { Masonry } from 'react-virtual-masonry';
  +import { Masonry } from 'kaskaid';
  ```

  **Breaking:** the data attributes emitted on the grid and its items are renamed. Update any CSS or test selectors that target them.

  ```diff
  -[data-rvm-grid]  [data-rvm-lanes]  [data-rvm-item]
  +[data-kaskaid-grid]  [data-kaskaid-lanes]  [data-kaskaid-item]
  ```

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- [#57](https://github.com/2wheeh/react-virtual-masonry/pull/57) [`47c1b44`](https://github.com/2wheeh/react-virtual-masonry/commit/47c1b44f4e4a499ca622a779d9ff5a3a0baaa271) Thanks [@2wheeh](https://github.com/2wheeh)! - Add `computeMasonryLayout({ sizes, lanes, gutter })` — a pure helper that returns the full shortest-column packing (`{ items: { index, lane, start, size }[], totalSize }`) so whole-list UIs like minimaps can reuse the library's layout instead of forking it.

- [#60](https://github.com/2wheeh/react-virtual-masonry/pull/60) [`9ff6257`](https://github.com/2wheeh/react-virtual-masonry/commit/9ff62579694b5d1add991803c8e952c3ac2edf54) Thanks [@2wheeh](https://github.com/2wheeh)! - `<Masonry>`'s `renderItem` callback now receives the full TanStack `VirtualItem` (`key`, `index`, `start`, `end`, `size`, `lane`) alongside the data `item`. This is additive — existing `({ item, index }) => ...` call sites keep working — and lets consumers read `lane` / `size` / `start` without dropping down to `useMasonry`.

- [#56](https://github.com/2wheeh/react-virtual-masonry/pull/56) [`2f05666`](https://github.com/2wheeh/react-virtual-masonry/commit/2f0566661de056235389880110e546a04223efe9) Thanks [@2wheeh](https://github.com/2wheeh)! - `useMasonry` now returns `scrollOffset` and `viewportSize` for the active scroller, so consumers building scroll-aware UI (minimaps, position indicators) don't need to attach their own scroll listener + ResizeObserver.

### Patch Changes

- [#59](https://github.com/2wheeh/react-virtual-masonry/pull/59) [`3eb0af9`](https://github.com/2wheeh/react-virtual-masonry/commit/3eb0af90958e3092c02e6ea69ebc39a01f0d8f52) Thanks [@2wheeh](https://github.com/2wheeh)! - drop baseUrl for ts7 compliance

- [#54](https://github.com/2wheeh/react-virtual-masonry/pull/54) [`2e08acc`](https://github.com/2wheeh/react-virtual-masonry/commit/2e08acc39b952c88ab76b70188719773102e843c) Thanks [@2wheeh](https://github.com/2wheeh)! - Clamp out-of-range indices before invoking the consumer's `estimateSize`, so estimators like `(i) => data[i].height` no longer throw when the virtualizer transiently probes an index outside the data range.

- [#55](https://github.com/2wheeh/react-virtual-masonry/pull/55) [`9998311`](https://github.com/2wheeh/react-virtual-masonry/commit/9998311fb67f6b1207e75b3a695daf0a09147d85) Thanks [@2wheeh](https://github.com/2wheeh)! - Re-export the `VirtualItem` type from `@tanstack/react-virtual`, so consumers can type items from `useMasonry`/`getItemProps` directly instead of deriving `UseMasonryReturn['items'][number]`.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- [#53](https://github.com/2wheeh/react-virtual-masonry/pull/53) [`f106053`](https://github.com/2wheeh/react-virtual-masonry/commit/f10605375d4448ba7ec1f6d374a035f2c7d01a26) Thanks [@2wheeh](https://github.com/2wheeh)! - Add `scrollElementRef` to `useMasonry` for virtualizing inside a scroll container. Pass a ref to an `overflow:auto` element and the grid windows against that element instead of the page; omit it for window scrolling (unchanged default). Container mode is client-only — `scrollElementRef` and `ssr` are mutually exclusive at the type level. Content above the grid inside the container must have stable height (simplest: make the grid the container's first child).

- [#52](https://github.com/2wheeh/react-virtual-masonry/pull/52) [`54bf8ba`](https://github.com/2wheeh/react-virtual-masonry/commit/54bf8ba5cff71a7701235c5870f6cb03dccaf091) Thanks [@2wheeh](https://github.com/2wheeh)! - Add `useEndReached`, a small fetching-agnostic hook for infinite loading. Pass it `useMasonry().items` plus your data length and a callback; it fires when the last rendered item nears the end of loaded data. Wire the callback to `fetchNextPage` (TanStack Query), `setSize` (SWR), `fetchMore` (Apollo), or any loader — the hook never fetches itself. The `<Masonry>` component also accepts `onEndReached` (with `endReachedThreshold` / `endReachedDisabled`) so component users get infinite loading without composing the hook.

- [#51](https://github.com/2wheeh/react-virtual-masonry/pull/51) [`424c621`](https://github.com/2wheeh/react-virtual-masonry/commit/424c62198085470930f2f5a65ba0de3c4fa665dc) Thanks [@2wheeh](https://github.com/2wheeh)! - Add first-class `scrollToIndex(index, options?)` to `useMasonry`. It's also reachable from the `<Masonry>` component via a `ref` typed `MasonryHandle` (exposing `scrollToIndex` and the `virtualizer` escape hatch), so imperative control no longer requires composing the hook.

### Patch Changes

- [#48](https://github.com/2wheeh/react-virtual-masonry/pull/48) [`670010c`](https://github.com/2wheeh/react-virtual-masonry/commit/670010c450f33294e11e29adeef537bab64beaa8) Thanks [@2wheeh](https://github.com/2wheeh)! - Added workaround for gutter to update vertical gap

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- [#44](https://github.com/2wheeh/react-virtual-masonry/pull/44) [`ad4086c`](https://github.com/2wheeh/react-virtual-masonry/commit/ad4086ccba0742393f3d9e68e84dcbacb1a75e44) Thanks [@2wheeh](https://github.com/2wheeh)! - **Breaking:** replace the `columnsCountBreakPoints` prop with a CSS-driven lane count. The library now reads the `--lanes` custom property from the grid root (`[data-rvm-grid]`), so `@media` / `@container` rules own responsiveness. Also extract the headless `useMasonry` hook (`<Masonry>` is now a thin wrapper) and rename `ssr.columnsCount` to `ssr.lanes`.

- [#42](https://github.com/2wheeh/react-virtual-masonry/pull/42) [`e7cbf96`](https://github.com/2wheeh/react-virtual-masonry/commit/e7cbf96bf025f2700d33746fa89c1f6ae28326fa) Thanks [@2wheeh](https://github.com/2wheeh)! - Add opt-in SSR rendering: pass `ssr={{ itemCount, scrollMargin, columnsCount }}` to render the first N items positioned in server HTML, using the same lane-assignment path the client uses.

### Patch Changes

- [#45](https://github.com/2wheeh/react-virtual-masonry/pull/45) [`04b8ba4`](https://github.com/2wheeh/react-virtual-masonry/commit/04b8ba463458214f584ff34963eb7722641d28c1) Thanks [@2wheeh](https://github.com/2wheeh)! - React ecosystem compliance: emit compiler-runtime imports that work on React 18 (`react-compiler-runtime` polyfill instead of React 19-only `react/compiler-runtime`), add a `'use client'` directive for React Server Components consumers, and stop reading refs during render in `useMasonry` (react-hooks v7 `refs` rule / concurrent-rendering safety).

- [#46](https://github.com/2wheeh/react-virtual-masonry/pull/46) [`b46dd85`](https://github.com/2wheeh/react-virtual-masonry/commit/b46dd854e2076701545bcf95791dc608aa044ca1) Thanks [@2wheeh](https://github.com/2wheeh)! - Keep `scrollMargin` fresh when content above the grid changes height: `useOffsetTop` also observes the document body, so ancestor layout shifts that move `offsetTop` without resizing the grid no longer leave the virtualizer's scroll mapping stale.
